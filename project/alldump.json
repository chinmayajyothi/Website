All our chemicals are water based, and every member is trained to execute proper safety procedures.</p>\r\n<br /> <b>Will Catalyst's STEM outreach program complement a school's existing science education system?</b>\r\n<p>Yes, our science education program is not just designed to 'WOW' and inspire an audience, but also to teach 'Next Generation' science standards in fields ranging from biology to computer science. Science is no longer an intimidating chapter in a textbook, but a tangible and inspiring experience.</p>\r\n<br /> <b>How can Administrators organize a science education program with Catalyst?</b>\r\n<p>Follow the link at the top of the page to sign up for a show, or contact us by the listed phone and email. A different chapter will be assigned to your school depending on your location and availability.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"sponsors\">Sponsors</h2>\r\n<b>How can i donate right now?</b>\r\n<p><a href=\"donate.php\">Click here</a> to see payment options. We will graciously accept any financial contribution.</p>\r\n<br /> <b>Is Catalyst's program sustainable?</b>\r\n<p>Since our incorporation, we have modeled our organization with sustainability is mind. Investing heavily in research and development, seeking renewable funding sources, and operating through high school and university chapters that function with a business like culture of efficiency means that Catalyst has the ability to grow, advance, and adapt far into the future.</p>\r\n<br /> <b>What expenses does the organization have?</b>\r\n<p>Our science education program requires modest expenditures for chemicals and materials required for both our magic shows and hands on science programs. Because we buy materials in bulk, we are able to get the most out of every dollar we receive. A cost analysis is available above.</p>\r\n<br /> <b>Is Catalyst a 501(c)(3) public charity or a 501(c)(3) private foundation?</b>\r\n<p>Catalyst is a 501(c)(3) public charity. As a public charity, we conduct direct services to the community, and derive our funding and support primarily from the general public, receiving grants from individuals, government, and private foundations.</p>\r\n<br /> <b>Will a grant or donation go toward paying salaries?</b>\r\n<p>No. Our members occupy volunteer positions in the organization, so they receive no financial compensation for their work.</p>\r\n<br /> <b>How are funds managed?</b>\r\n<p>When funds are required for reimbursement or material purchases they are withdrawn from our bank account.

It takes a determined well rounded individual who is able to communicate effectively and respectfully. Our chapters also need artists, computer programmers, skilled writers, and graphic designers.</p>\r\n<br /> <b>My school doesn't have a chapter, can I start one?</b>\r\n<p>Yes, yes you can! Starting a Catalyst chapter is a bit more involved than starting a usual club, but then, Catalyst is anything but usual!</p>\r\n<br /> <b>My high school is in or near San Diego county:</b>\r\n<p>The first step is to contact a representative from the organization.

Jason&rsquo;s mother inspired his interest in chemistry by showing him a simple experiment when he was young.

With Erik&rsquo;s assistance, volunteers from the audience exploded hydrogen balloons. For the next demonstration, another volunteer poured a clear solution into three separate beakers, resulting in solutions of red, white, and blue (the colors of the American flag). The next &nbsp;two experiment utilized oscillating reactions that caused solutions to change color. The students were divided into teams and encouraged&nbsp;to cheer for a color. Excited by the challenge, the students enthusiastically&nbsp;did so as the two solutions transformed from gold to black and orange to brown, respectively. Next, a student caused a flammable paper cup to spontaneously ignite by &ldquo;thinking about fire.&rdquo; Finally, the performance ended with one more exploding hydrogen balloon. After the experiments, Jason revealed that there was no magic involved in these incredible demonstrations; it was all chemistry. He then explained the science behind each experiment.</p>\r\n<p class=\"c3\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"c4\">This first event was more successful than anyone could&rsquo;ve expected.

Principal Bob Rodrigo stated, \"Your show engaged our students and staff from beginning to end...our students left your show motivated &nbsp;that they too could be great scientists!&rdquo; Mary Zhao, Catalyst's Director of Show Design, confirmed that the kids&rsquo; reactions were &ldquo;beyond our expectations&rdquo; and the kids &ldquo;enjoyed participating in the show.&nbsp;I felt like our work really paid off and it was a great start.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</div>", "rating_sum": 0, "rating_count": 0, "categories": [], "publish_date": "2013-02-02T05:22:06Z", "status": 2, "updated": "2014-07-01T04:22:18.671Z", "description": "\nFebruary 1, 2013 \u2013 Catalyst for\u00a0Success held its first official event at Sundance Elementary School.

He also showed the board a short video demo (which can also be found on Catalyst&rsquo;s youtube page).

Through numerous magic shows and hands-on after school programs, the student run Science Education Division of Catalyst has successfully exposed students across San Diego, in elementary, middle, and high school, to science on an incredible scale. The organization has performed for eight schools, including two Title 1, low income schools. At every performance, one aspect of Catalyst&rsquo;s shows has remained constant, every student in the audience is engaged and genuinely excited.</p>\r\n<p class=\"c1\">Also this week, Catalyst for Success&nbsp;continued expansion of&nbsp;the organization&rsquo;s after school science program to Meadowbrook Middle School. Jason Ge, Jacob Zemper, Tina Quach, and Jordan Ramos gave a presentation on the importance of STEM to over 100 middle school students before allowing the kids to try hands on experiments and ask questions about science competitions and STEM education opportunities in high school. In mid March, Tina Quach, Cameron Ramos, Jason Ge, Josh Shanes, and Jake Zemper facilitated the first program at Cherokee Point elementary in the disadvantaged North Park neighborhood east of Downtown San Diego.&nbsp;Josh Shanes, Catalyst&rsquo;s Director of Fundraising, stated, &ldquo;I loved it! I thought it was so much fun. The kids thought it was great to actually DO the experiments and I loved knowing that I made a large contribution to them feeling that way!&rdquo; Tina Quach, Vice President of Science Programs is currently working to expand our follow up program to more schools.

After reviewing hundreds of applications, Catalyst welcomed 17 new members to the organization in early April. This week, new members attended orientations to learn more about how Catalyst operates, and have already begun completing assignments and signing up to participate in upcoming events. Confident that new members will provide enough resources to accommodate an expansion of operations, Cameron Ramos and Jason Ge completed scheduling events for over 10,000 students by the end of May. Scheduling efforts are now being concentrated on year round schools and STEM related summer programs. The organization, working with the operations and technology departments, configured online financing to allow Catalyst to receive electronic donations. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"c1\">About Catalyst for Success:</p>\r\n<p class=\"c3\">As STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education receives greater attention globally, Catalyst for Success aims to introduce the more captivating and interesting side of science to young students through chemistry &ldquo;magic&rdquo; shows, demonstrations of simple chemistry experiments pitched as magic.
